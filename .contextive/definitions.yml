    terms:
      - name: Compacted Reading
        definition: An aggregated representation of multiple sensor readings in some facility over a certain period of time.
        examples:
          - Sensor readings are compacted once in 10 seconds for each facility, but window size is easily configurable.

      - name: Facility
        definition: Simulated physical location of sensors.
        examples:
          - If number of facilities is configured to be 3, facility names would be facility_1, facility_2, and facility_3.
          - Each facility has multiple sensors.
          - Before saving to database, sensor readings are compacted for each facility, but not across facilites.

      - name: Reading
        definition: A single value generated by a sensor at some point in time.
        examples:
          - The higher the number of the facility, the more variance its sensor readings demonstrate.

      - name: Sensor
        definition: A simulated device which reports generated readings.
        examples:
          - In our demo, we simulate humidity, pressure, and temperature sensors.
