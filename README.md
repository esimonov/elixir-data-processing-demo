# Data Processing Pipeline

This project is a distributed system built to simulate, collect, process, store, and serve sensor data. Designed as an Elixir [umbrella project](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/umbrella_projects), it comprises multiple applications, each handling a specific part of the data pipeline:

- [Data Generator](/apps/data_generator/): Simulates sensor readings and publishes them.
- [Data Compactor](/apps/data_compactor/): Subscribes to sensor data, compacts it, and publishes compacted data.
- [Data Server](/apps/data_server/): Consumes compacted data, stores it, and exposes via a JSON API.
- [Schema](/apps/schema/): Contains the Protobuf schema definitions for the data model, as well as encoding/decoding helpers.

Itâ€™s primarily a learning project, aimed at exploring and gaining hands-on experience with Elixir's capabilities.

## Running locally

Requires Elixir 1.17+ and Docker Compose for running Kafka, MongoDB, and Mosquitto (MQTT broker).

```sh
# Start Kafka, MongoDB, MQTT.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Export secrets for Kafka and Mongo.
export $(cat .env.local | xargs) && iex -S mix

# Install and compile dependencies.
mix deps.get && mix deps.compile

# Start the apps.
iex -S mix
```

Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/sensors/facility_1` to verify it's up and running.

## Running in Docker

If you don't have Elixir installed, the demo can be run in a Docker container.

```sh
# Build the image: the release (build artefact) will include all the three applications.
docker build --no-cache --tag data-processing-pipeline -f docker/Dockerfile . --progress=plain

# Start the app along with Kafka, MongoDB, MQTT.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.override.yml up
```

Kafka container takes some time to stabilize, so encountering `errconnrefused` errors shortly after startup is normal.
